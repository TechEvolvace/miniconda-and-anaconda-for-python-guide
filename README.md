## About Conda, Miniconda, and Anaconda Distribution
Both Miniconda and Anaconda Distributions contains useful Python-based tools for machine learning and data science, and they both have Conda when installing them. 

Conda is the package manager that allow developers to install, uninstall, and manage these Python-based tools for any Python-based project. 

Miniconda is the lightweight version of Anaconda Distribution, where it comes with fewer Python-based tools when installed but also uses less memory space than Anaconda Distribution.
